## Introduction to GCNs

Graph Convolutional Networks extend neural network-based modeling to graph-structured data. Instead of dealing with grid-like data (images, sequences), GCNs use graph convolutions to capture relationships between nodes in a graph. 

### Key Topics in GCN Research

- **Spectral and Spatial Methods**: Different approaches to define graph convolution.
- **Message Passing**: Passing information between graph neighbors to update node embeddings.
- **Applications**: Social network analysis, recommender systems, drug discovery, traffic forecasting, and more.
